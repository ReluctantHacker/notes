# Basic nature of probability and statistics
In short, we can say that Probability tells you how to go from a population to a sample, and statistics tell you how to go from a sample to a population.

Before we start, there's some important mathematical terms we should know:
  * **Population**: A **set** of all the data. For example, a population of a city means all the people in that city is our samples. In short, total data collection we want to discuss.
  * **Sample**: One Randomly selected from population. Of course, you can have many samples ramdomly selected.
  * **Outcome Value**: the value of randomly selected sample.
  * **Expected Value**: Which is the reasonable 'predicted value' of a sample drawn from the population. This value is the sum of all data points multiplied by their respective probabilities of occurrence (it is not the average value of the samples, don't get confused, the concepts are different).

Expected value is derived from Population and Sample. So the only two basic concept ideas are Population and Sample. All the other theories or ideas are came from those two basic concepts.

First we are gonna discuss about is, What is random? Or more specifically, what is the nature of "random"?


Binomial distribution
---------------------
Two outcome values of samples


Multinomial distribution
------------------------
Multiple outcome values of samples. The important fact is that, if we have n outcomes values(or categories) the distribution diagram is n dimensional! In binomial distribution(Bernoullie trial, 1 or 0), if we have 10 tests, we want to know how many times the outcomes value is 1. This is simple combination problem. However, in **trinomial distribution**(0, 1, 2) problem, we want to know how many times the value is 1 or 2! There are two things we want to know. So the diagram would be 3 dimensional.

Why randomness generates "distribution"? The randomness should be totally unpredictable? The key point is that the number of events. [0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]. They are all have two 1. However [1, 1, 1] is the only events of three 1.

> The following notes is possibly wrong! Just read but dont' take it too seriously! ------>  The essence of randomness is "unpredictability (uncertainty)". It is impossible to predict what "event" will occur at a certain time and place. This is what we call randomness. However, the reason why there are "patterns" in randomness is that we impose some restrictions on it. For example, if we limit the possible "events" to a few types at a certain time and place, such as rolling a dice where the outcomes are only 1, 2, ...6, this is called "restricting the range of events". This restriction creates boundaries for randomness, leading to "patterns" and "distributions", which are certain "rules" of randomness. But if "randomness" itself has no restrictions, then the events that occur at any time and place are completely without boundaries, meaning any event can happen. Thus, there would be no "patterns", "distributions", or "rules". This is complete randomnessâ€”completely unpredictable randomness.
