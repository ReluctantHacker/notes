Suppose we have 
``` math
f(\theta) = cos(\theta) + i sin(\theta)
```

You can easily prove that 
``` math
f(\alpha + \beta) = f(\alpha) f(\beta)
```

And this means that, this is **uniqueness theorem** which is widely used in solving equations or function, and it means if a solution fit, then it is the only solution.
``` math
f(\theta) = A e^{\zeta \theta}
```

And because, 
``` math
f(0) = A e^0 = A = cos(0) + i sin(0) = 1
```

so 
```
A = 1
```

And because,
``` math
f'(0) = \zeta e^0 = \zeta = -sin(0) + i cos(0) = i
```

so 
``` math
\zeta = i
```

so
``` math
e^{i \theta} = cos(\theta) + i sin(\theta)
```
