After you finishing download and install "TinyLaTex", You should do one more, doing this below:

# Add TinyTeX to the PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH"

This path would actually add "pdflatex" executing file (which can compile .tex files to pdf files) to the path. (Of course, if you want to add the path 
permanently, You should add this path to ".bashrc")
