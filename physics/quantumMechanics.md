# Intuition
The wave function is the most important idea of quantum mechanics. The story is roughly start from the two properties of light which is photon. People found that light have matter property(like particle, photoelectronic effect) and wave property(through some earlier experiments). The wave properties had been now for many years then. The surprising thing is the matter property or also known as the particle property which is spread widely because of Issac Newton but been abandon through 19th century. Anyway, We have two important results of particle-wave relationship below:
```math 
E=h\nu
P=\dfrac{h}{\lambda}
```
## Plank
The first quantum idea was from Plank's black body radiation problem. He assumed that the energy can only be quantized which is exactly $E=h\nu$ and perfectly fit the black radiation experiment result.

## Einstein
Later, Einstein totally used Plank's formula in photoelectronic effect problem and it perfectly match the experiment results.

## Bohr
After that, Plank's constant got used again by Bohr to construct his beautiful model of hydrogen atom by using the idea of quantized orbits. 

People was getting realized that something continuous distributed in their thought is actually quantized.

Bohr's model has some sincere problems. But the one and most important one is that why electron stand still circular around the nuclear without falling because of contiunous radiation by electron's circular motion?

## Debrogile
Bohr's model was still a classical motion of electron. Debrogile realized this and push way more farther to get that if electron is a wave, then there's no such radiation because of circular motion.

But if electron is a wave, what's the form this wave should be like? Photon! He thought.

He assumed that electron's matter-wave relationship is the same as photon's one, the orbits of Bohr's model are just standing waves.

## Shrodinger
But what is the meaning of this so called wave actually is? Same as the form of light! Shrodinger thought.

He assumed that if electron's matter-wave relationship is the same as photon's one, then the wave should mean the same.

What is the meaning of light wave as we known? We know that the electromagnetic wave is like below
```math
E(x, t) = e^(kx - \omega t)
```

the E means electric field.

Schrodinger assumed that matter wave should be the same form which is like below:
```math
\Phi(x, t) = e^(kx-\omega t)
```

But what does this mean?

Electromagnetic wave itself is indeed a wave but it has no matter-meaning at all, it doesn't tell anything about what the photons(which is the electromagnetic wave's particle form) does.(Noticed one electromagnetic wave doesn't mean it is one photon)

> [!NOTE] 
> There's also another thing. Photon(electromagnetic wave) itself wouldn't interact with any other photon.(even though it would interact with electrical particles, but they are not photons). So matter wave, according to the assumptions for the similarity of photon and matter, shouldn't interact with other matter(Although it should interact with other thing, but it's not matter, and we only focus on matter now)

Although, electromagnetic wave itself has no matter-meaning to iteslf. The square of it has! 

The classical electrodynamics tells us that the intersity $I = \dfrac{1}{2}\epislon_0cE^2$ which is the energy per time per area of the wave itself.

We also know that one photon's energy is:
```math
E=h\nu
```
So this means $E^2$ is proportional to how many photons per time per area. 

More specifically, instantaneous energy density $\mu\left(x, t\right)$
```math
\mu\left(x, t\right) = \epsilon_0 E\left(x, t\right)^2
```

This tells the energy denesity at specific point of space and time! which is telling how many photons at specific point of space and time!




According to matter-wave relationships:
```math
E=h\nu
P=\dfrac{h}{\lambda}
```

we know three things below:
```math
c=\nu \lambda
\omega=2\pi\nu
k=\dfrac{2\pi}{\lamda}
```

which can let this result:
```math
E=\dfrac{h\omega}{2\pi}
P=\dfrac{hk}{2\pi}
```

which can let this result:
```math
\Phi(x, t) = e^(kx - \omega t)
```
