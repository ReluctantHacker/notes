# Maxwell's equations
Generally, electrodynamics including four major laws which are **electrostatics(靜電)**, **magnetostatics(靜磁)**, **electrodynamics(動電生磁)**, **magnetodynamics(動磁生電)** 
## electrostatics(靜電)
Follow the Gauss's law for electricity. 
Differential Form:
```math
\nabla \cdot E = \dfrac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}
```
