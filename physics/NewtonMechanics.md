# Chapter_1. Brief History
  * Before Newton, there no definition of "force". The definition of force is whether an object gains acceleration. Thus, defining "force" also defines "inertia"(with force there is acceleration, without force there is uniform motion). "Force" and "inertia" actaully bond together, as they refer to the same concept. Without the support of Newtonian mechanics, astronomy which is one of the main target of mechanics would be reduced to an empirical summary without any explanatory foundation.

# Chapter_2. Newton's three laws of motion
  * **First Law**: Law of Inertia
  * **Second Law**: Define $$F = ma = {dP \over dt} $$
  * **Third Law**: Every action (force) in nature there is an equal and opposite reaction
  * The above three laws are actually equivalent with each others, **conversation of momentum**. The situation is as follows:
    * The Law of Inertia states that no force no acceleration, and with force with acceleration, which is exactly the same thing as $$F = ma$$. Therefore, the first law is equivalent to the second law.
    * The second law, $$F = ma = {dP \over dt}$$, indicates that without force, there is no change in momentum, which is conservation of momentum. Hence, the second law is equivalent to the conservation of momentum.
    * Assuming "spatial symmetry (including translational symmetry, rotational symmetry)" holds, consider basic particles A and B. If they are the same type of particle (assuming homogeneity), they have identical properties but different states of motion. If particle A exerts an attractive force on particle B, then particle B must exert an equal and opposite force on particle A due to their identical properties and adherence to spatial symmetry (this mutual attraction has no primary or secondary; both are active participants). This situation is equivalent to the third law. The macroscopic world is composed of microscopic particles, thus it must also follow the third law. Therefore, conservation of momentum is equivalent to the third law (if spatial symmetry and particle homogeneity hold) which implies the second laws is equivalent to the third law.

# Chapter_3. Newton's law of Universal Gravitation
  * Newton realized that the motion of celestial bodies and the falling of an apple are governed by the same kind of force. The law is described as follows:
    * **Gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects.**
      * Newton chose an inverse square laws because it fits Kepler's law of Planetary motion. Here's how it is:
        * For a uniform circular orbit of radius r, the acceleration is 
        * $$
          a = \omega^2r, \omega = {2\pi \over T}, --> (A)
          $$
        * where T is the orbital period. Comparing eq. (A) with Kepler's third law
        * $$
          T^2 \propto r^3,  --> (B)
          $$
        * We can conclude that gravitational acceleration 
        * $$
          a \propto r^(-2)  --> (C)
          $$
        * So a is proportional to the inverse square distance r. [reference](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/128245/how-was-newton-able-to-guess-that-gravitational-force-is-inversely-proportional)
    * **Gravitational force is directly proportional to the masses of the objects.**
      * The idea is that if two objects attract each other, the force between them must be related to a certain "property" of the objects. This property is called "gravitational mass" (this newly hypothesized property is not the same as inertial mass, though for convenience we call it mass. Later, it will be proven that they are the same because gravitational force is equivalent to inertial force, as per Einstein's principle of equivalence in General Relativity. But here, we initially consider them as different properties). In fact, even in Newton's time, it was observed that when measuring gravity using devices like balances, gravitational mass was proportional to inertial mass. However, Newton did not delve deeply into their essence. 
    * Combining these two principles below, we get: 
      * $$
        F = GMm \over (r^2) 
        $$
