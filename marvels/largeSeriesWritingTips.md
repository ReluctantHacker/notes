Create world view before writing
--------------------------------
The world view including **background story** or the **history** of the fictionary world. And also should include every **characters** you want to build including their **peronality**, **outline story** from begin to end. This is very important design world view very carefully because it's highly not possible to go back to rewrite everything if you've already write so much. 

You also need to list all the big events that should happened and plans what characters should be relevent in every event.

Create outline for every chapter before writing
-----------------------------------------------
The plot line of every chapters should be connected seriously, which means strictly logical with every part of it. So it need to be design properly in the first begining or it could be something threw a wrench in the story plan and make you hard to finish the writing just like George Martin fail to finish his Game of Throne.

The outline doesn't have to and shouldn't be too detailed but you have to handle the **Pace** of the story telling. Every chapter may have different emotion you want to give to audience, like sad, happy, heart warming, etc, different emotion would have different writing layout which need to practice or through reading to gain more skill. 

How to write faster?
--------------------
Writing practice, like small story writing, or reading, can somehow improve the speed.

However, it's not possible to write fast and accurate if you have no plan at all. So it's important to construct the outline design like above tips I mentioned. Once you finished the Designed blueprint, you should be able to improve the speed to another level or at least, a comfortable speed.
