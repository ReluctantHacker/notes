  * **ch10**(機器戰警): At the congressional hearing, HouYong faces pressure from both the Blue and Green Party legislators. The Blue Party adopts a "mild criticism, strong support" stance, questioning the poor law enforcement environment and the lack of police resources while simultaneously acknowledging Hou Yong’s efforts. They emphasize the effectiveness of the RoboCop program in assisting law enforcement and urge the government not to delay its implementation due to opposition from the Green Party. The Green Party, on the other hand, launches a strong attack, accusing Hou Yong of acting swiftly in the BaiYan princess kidnapping case while being inefficient in handling ordinary crimes. They imply selective law enforcement(選擇性辦案) and hint at his possible ties with corporations and certain political forces. Additionally, they attempt to probe whether there is a "special informant" or an "anti-infiltration operation" within the police force, trying to extract information from Hou Yong or his superiors regarding the identity of an undercover agent. Hou Yong must carefully navigate his responses—he cannot allow the Green Party to uncover the undercover agent while also keeping his future allegiance to the Blue Party concealed. At the start of the hearing, Guan Yin, the Chief of the AI Division at Starlink Corporation, is already present, having been invited by the Blue Party as a technical consultant. She is a young, exceptionally intelligent, and stunningly beautiful woman, dressed in a form-fitting high-tech uniform, exuding a composed and elegant demeanor. Under the guidance of Blue Party legislators, she delivers a live demonstration of the RoboCop’s capabilities. A towering, imposing robotic officer follows her commands, showcasing pinpoint shooting accuracy, rapid response deterrent actions, and intelligent threat assessment. Supporting her arguments with precise data, she highlights the key advantages of AI law enforcement: RoboCops do not accept bribes, do not experience fatigue, and do not make human errors, significantly enhancing police efficiency. When confronted by the Green Party’s criticisms, she calmly refutes their claims, arguing that AI enforcement ensures humane law enforcement standards and that Starlink is willing to accept democratic oversight—turning the argument against the Green Party and making it difficult for them to counter her stance. Her speech garners strong support from the Blue Party, strengthening the momentum for the RoboCop program in the public discourse. However, Hou Yong keenly senses a deeper agenda—Starlink Corporation is not merely promoting technology but is actively maneuvering to reshape the balance of power within law enforcement, making RoboCops a political weapon in the ongoing struggle between factions.
