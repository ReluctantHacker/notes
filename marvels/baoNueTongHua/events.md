At that moment, a group of high school students passes by with a tour guide, providing an opportunity to explain that the purpose of the War Memorial Park is to remind people of the pain and cruelty of war. Shanhu makes a mistake in sign language, Liyang hits her, and Shanhu starts crying, drawing the attention of Billy, who speaks up in discontent but is instead taught a lesson by Liyang’s superior martial arts.

Liyang then takes Shanhu to see several war installations, eventually arriving at a human experimentation lab. The atmosphere inside is grayish-blue, and rows of lifelike wax statues of young girls stand in formation, their abdomens split open like grotesque grins—these are remnants of organ-based human experiments meant to test how long a person could survive under the loss of different organs. It is said that some of these girls lived for one to two years. Here, they encounter the high school students and their tour guide again. The atmosphere is lively and noisy, and some students tease the wax figures without any sense of solemnity, which angers the guide.

  * **ch4**(The Name Not Heard Yet): WangYu, 45 years old, was originally a programmer at a small company. He was laid off in middle age due to the rise of AI, and after struggling to find a job, he could only work at a Crab Bao fast food restaurant. He has been working there for more than three months, responsible for cashiering and delivering food. His colleague is Ruǎntáng, a rebellious 17-year-old girl. WangYu is clumsy, and during a busy period with many customers, Ruǎntáng occasionally helps, while sarcastically commenting that ZhangYu, who used to be a programmer, can't even use the food machines—he's dumber than a robot. At this point, it's explained that CrabBao Fast Food has fired the old chef, LaoJin, and replaced him with the latest robot, Haimao ErBaiWu, to handle all food preparation. This robot has the ability to learn new dishes. However, Haimao ErBaiWu keeps repeating the same meals, failing to prepare the dishes customers ordered. Customers start complaining. Boss Xie comes out of his office to assess the situation but can't solve the problem. He hopes that Ruǎntáng, who had helped LaoJin in the kitchen before, can temporarily take over the robot’s job. However, Ruǎntáng, known for her stubborn personality, complains about being exploited. The two almost get into a fight, but WangYu says he has a solution. He explains that he used to work with a similar robot at his old company and has encountered similar issues before. He guesses that the problem is caused by a database deadlock. While this robot can learn new dishes, its intelligence is very limited, and it’s not AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), so it can't understand why repeating tasks isn't working. Boss Xie is skeptical of WangYu, but with customers still complaining, he reluctantly lets WangYu try. WangYu goes to the kitchen and asks Boss Xie for the system management password. Soon after, he manages to fix the robot. The robot now prepares meals quickly. Although customers continue to complain, the meals are quickly replenished, temporarily solving the crisis. After work, WangYu is about to leave when Ruǎntáng stops him and invites him for a drink. WangYu was planning to pick up his daughter, but seeing there's still some time, he agrees. The two chat about many things, including Ruǎntáng's red electronic eyes, hinting that she might have experienced some misfortune in her past. She also shares that her dream is to open a gym. WangYu talks about his considerate daughter, XiaoHua, who works part-time and studies to ease WangYu's burden. XiaoHua is his only motivation to keep going. He also mentions that Ruǎntáng and XiaoHua are about the same age and might become friends, though he quickly dismisses the thought after considering Ruǎntáng's rebellious appearance. The two even discuss politics, the blue and green parties. Despite their differences in gender, age, personality, and experiences, tonight, they speak as though they’ve been friends for years, enjoying the conversation. Afterward, they part ways. WangYu rides his bike to the beef noodle shop where his daughter works, only to find a police car surrounded by a crowd. He pushes through to check, only to discover that his daughter has been attacked. She is rushed to the hospital and barely survives but requires immediate surgery. WangYu takes all his savings and hires the best doctor, KePi.
