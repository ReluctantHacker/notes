# cloud and fog
They are the same thing which is **small drop of water** that is small enough to flow on atmosphere but in different position, height and location. In the high sky, it's cloud. In the ground or low placement, we call them fog. There's no strickly definition of the size of water drop range of small drop but generally the water drops that can flow, we would call them small drops. 

# precipitation particle 
if water drop is big enough to overcome the force of flow and is dropping, then we call them precipitation particles or just rainy drop.

# Weather Surveillance Radar
There are a lotta way to detect the amount rainy(dropping big water drop)






# Rainfall Measurement Technologies (Brief Summary)

## 1. Radar
- Detects rain, snow, hail using electromagnetic waves.
- Fast, wide coverage, continuous data.
- Types: Doppler, dual-polarization, phased array.
- Indirect measurement, needs calibration.

## 2. Rain Gauges
- Directly measure rainfall at ground level.
- Accurate but limited coverage.

## 3. Satellites
- Observe clouds and moisture globally.
- Good coverage, but lower resolution than radar.

The Radar is actually the main tech to use nowaday for most serious situation. And it's main tech is detetching the so called precipitation particle which is big water drop.
