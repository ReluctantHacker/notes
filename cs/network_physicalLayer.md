# Wired Media in computer network
The simplest form of wired media is called **coaxial cable** which is simply just a single metal wire covered by insulating layer. 

Here's a question, how data or signal transmit through a metal wire? Can we imagine it as some kinda waveform going through the media?

When a wave is traveling through media. Different frequencies of wave should have different speed in same media.

Normally, a wave is constructed with continuous spectrum of wave length. And when a wave go through some media(suppose not vacuum), then **dispersion** would happen. Dispersion is continuous phenomena if the spectrum of that wave is continuous. Dispersion also happen in the electric signal through wired media.

And it's not just the hit time of different frequencies wave are different. The loss of the different frequencies through same media should be different, too. To solve this problem, we need equalizer and
