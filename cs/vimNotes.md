- in Vim, when you open a terminal by using the command ":terminal" or "ter", you would find that you can't scroll up or down in that terminal. In this time, you should doing the command "Ctrl + \" and then "Ctrl + n", this would make that terminal from "Input Mode" into "Normal Mode"! then you can use vim's jklh or other usual command to scroll up or down. You can use press "i" to go back to input mode just like editing text files.  For more details, "Ctrl + /" is actually telling vim that you want to do some special control, and then "Ctrl + n" is one of the special control.
