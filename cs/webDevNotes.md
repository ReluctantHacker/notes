# short history
Before we talk about **World Wide Web** which is the main topic we are gonna discuss later, we have to learn some history to fully understand the whole story.

After Internet was invented, a lot communication technologies(some of them are still uesd today) created based on it.

  * **ARPANET(since 1969 to 1989)**: ARPANET was the first operational packet-switching network and the precursor to the internet. It connected four universities in the United States and allowed researchers to share resources and communicate2.

  * **Email(since 1971)**A

Email (1971)
Ray Tomlinson sent the first email in 1971, using the @ symbol to separate the user from the host. This innovation revolutionized communication by allowing messages to be sent between different computers on the ARPANET2.

TCP/IP (1983)
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) were standardized in 1983. These protocols became the foundation for data transmission across the internet, enabling different networks to communicate with each other

DNS (1983)
The Domain Name System (DNS) was introduced in 1983. DNS acts like the internet's phone book, translating human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other1.

5. Telnet
Description: A protocol for remote login to computers over a network.
First Use: 1969.
Current Use: While less common today due to security concerns, Telnet is still used for accessing legacy systems and network devices that do not support more secure protocols like SSH (Secure Shell).
