# Basic idea
- .net is a framework that supports(mainly) programming languages including C#, F#, Visual Basic(.NET).  
- .net framework also includes some subframeworks(Those frameworks all can be for C#, F# and VB.NET) 
  - **Windows Forms(WinForms)**: 
    - **purpose**: Building traditional desktop applications with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Drag-and-drop UI design: Simplifies layout creation in Visual Studio.
    - **properties**: 
      - Event-driven: Relies heavily on events triggered by user actions (e.g., button clicks).
      - Drag-and-drop UI design: Simplifies layout creation in Visual Studio.
    - **structure**:
      - Applications are organized around "Forms" (e.g., Form1) where GUI elements like buttons, textboxes, etc., are placed.
      - Code-behind files manage event handlers and business logic.
  - **Windows Presentation Foundation(WPF)**:
    - **purpose**: Creating visually sophisticated and modern desktop applications.
    - **properties**:
      - XAML-based: Uses XML-like markup (XAML) to define UI elements.
      - Data binding: Easily binds UI components to data sources.
      - Supports animations and vector graphics.
    - **structure**: 
      - Separation of concerns with XAML files (UI design) and code-behind files (logic).
      - Uses "MVVM" (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern for better code organization. 
  - **ASP.NET**:
    - **purpose**: Developing web applications and APIs.
    - **properties**: 
      - Supports dynamic web pages and backend services.
      - Offers variations like ASP.NET WebForms, MVC, and Core.
    - **structure**:
      - MVC Pattern: Model (data), View (UI), Controller (business logic).
      - Organized into separate folders for controllers, models, and views.
