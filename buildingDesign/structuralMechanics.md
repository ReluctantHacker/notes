# Basic elements
## Columns
When we discussion about structural mechanics about building. The first thing we may discuss about is how our weight affect the building and how the building support our weight. Let's start from a most basic situation. Suppose we have two columns and slab on the top. We have a load on the slab. The slab would have a bend force caused by the weight of the load. When the load is closer to the position of columns, the less the slab bend because more weight is directly supported by the columns themself. If the load is on the top of the slab at the position of middle of two columns, the bend force would be largest. This is intuition.

If the load is on the middle position of two columns, slab would have most largest bending force. Suppose the bending force is more than the material itself can handle, the slab would break. Now we can add additional columns on the middle of the original two columns to avoid this kind of situation. So the structural designer should consider about how much weight the slab usually have support to decide how many columns should be have.

## Wall
The strongest possible structure, of course, would be the infinite columns between the original two columns. Then we don't need to worry about the slab **bending problem** because all the position on the slab is directly supported by the columns. Those columns, of course, is what we called a wall.

The thing can directly expand to the 3 direction, that suppose we have 4 columns for each of them is on the corner of a square. And then on the top of them, we have a **floor**. Of course, the floor would be bend if we have a load on the it except the load is directly on the top of the columns. The strongest structure possible would be if we have infinite columns in between the four columns, this would make the structure totally a solid cube. This is the strongest possible structure but not a smart design at all because first we loss the space between the four columns, and second, waste too many material. So the designer should take balance about the structure strength, the spare space we can use for living or moving and also the cost.

## Beam
Beam is a smart way to save money and also add additional strength to the slab we discussed about. 

Because slab would be bend, if we want space free to living and walking, we can add columns infinitely. So another directly idea would be add some additional strength on the slab itself. Intuitively, if we add the thickness of the slab. The slab would be stronger, it can tolerate more bending force. However, sometimes(or most time in modern day), we don't need that much additional strength to slab because it would make the whole building too heavy and redundant. We only add the thickness on the edge of the slab. In 3 dimensional situation. The slab would be the floor. And the additional thickness on the edges of the floor is exactly what we call the beam.
